Embedded ML-Based Real-time Anomaly Monitoring for Laundry Machines. A project I worked on to get comfortable with Embedded Machine Learning on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. I developed tinyML k-means and anomaly detection algorithms on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense for irregular load detection based on vibration, accelerometer, and audio data
